Networking TO-DOs:

MINIMUM:
. Make it clear what you send vs what you received (fix "You: ")


PROBLEMS:
. The person that exits will get the message that the other person exited.
. The person that got ghosted (meaning the other exited) will NOT have their program end WITHOUT std::terminate. THIS HOWEVER GIVES AN EXCEPTION, WHICH WILL END THE PROGRAM AFTER HITTING RETRY. NOT A GOOD WAY THOUGH, NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE!!!

QUESTIONS:
.
