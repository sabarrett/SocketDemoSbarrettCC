run the server FIRST via command line: SocketDemo.exe server
run the client via command line: SocketDemo.exe

press the escape key to end the Allegro Display

server is a green circle
client is a red square

movement on both apps is just Up Down Left Right

the rain is the third object

it is jittery as hell but whatever, I am proud of it...
